Haley Feedback
x I'd make the nav bar text on the Home page a lot smaller, it's pretty overpowering. (It looks bigger than the "An" and "Alphabet" text)
x Along with that, bumping up the size of "An" "Alphabet" would help too.
x The caption below the caricature in the About page gets a little lost with the body text wrapping below it. Maybe put them in different columns or something so the text doesn't wrap below it? 
x The nav bar in the poem looks awesome!! I'd just bring it up off the bottom edge of the window a scotch if possible to let it breathe. (15-20 px?? It's hard to estimate haha)
x Is it possible to make the first letter in the poems a bit bigger and more prominent?
